<h1>The Scenario</h1>
<p>Your mouse controls a robot in a flat plane, and you want to know its location. Unfortunatley, the robot is in an almost entirely empty space that provides very little information that can be used to localize. The only usable feature in your environment is a pillar near its center. With your robot's sensors, you can determine the following information at any point in time:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The robot's velocity</li>
	<li>The angle between the robot's direction of motion and the pillar</li>
	<li>The distance from the robot to the pillar</li>
</ul>
